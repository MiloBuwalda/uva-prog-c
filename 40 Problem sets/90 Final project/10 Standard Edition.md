# Final Project

The climax of this course is its final project. The final project is your
opportunity to take your knowledge of programming out for a spin and develop
your very own piece of software. So long as your project draws upon this
course's lessons, the nature of your project is entirely up to you, albeit
subject to the staff's approval. You may implement your project in any
language(s) as long as the staff approves. You are welcome to utilize
infrastructure other than the CS50 Appliance, provided the staff ultimately
has access to any hardware and software that your project requires. All that
we ask is that you build something of interest to you, that you make something
useful, that you solve an actual problem, or that you somehow impact campus.
Strive to create something that outlives this course.

Inasmuch as software development is rarely a one-person effort, you are
allowed an opportunity to collaborate with one or two fellow students for this
final project. Needless to say, it is expected that every student in any such
group contribute equally to the design and implementation of that groupâ€™s
project. Moreover, it is expected that the scope of a two- or three-person
group's project be, respectively, twice or thrice that of a typical one-person
project. A one-person project, mind you, should entail more time and effort
than is required by each of the course's problem sets.

Extensions on the final project are not granted, except in cases of emergency.
Technical difficulties are not considered emergencies. Problem sets' late days
cannot be spent on the final project. Lateness of submissions is determined
down to the minute by submissions' timestamps. Submitting more than seven
minutes late is equivalent to not submitting at all.
