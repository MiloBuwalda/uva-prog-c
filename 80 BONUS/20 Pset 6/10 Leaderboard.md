# Who is the fastest?

* To spice things up, there is a little competition who can make the fastest
  implementation of dictionary.c. If you think you have a fast implementation,
  send a `.tar.gz` of your solution to <m.vanbeek@uva.nl>. He will add you in
  the table below. If you turn out to have the fastest implementation of all
  students, a fabulous price awaits.

* Your solution is run on Marin's laptop, using the text `iliad.txt` and the
  dictionary `large`.

## DEADLINE

* We will accept entries up and until the **8th of April, 2013**.
