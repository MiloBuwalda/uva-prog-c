# Transition from MIT 600

If you've done the first part of the MIT 600 course, it's best to do a few more problem sets from that course, and then return here for pset7.

* Do MIT problem sets [5 and 6](http://600.mprog.nl/) (or later problem sets)
* Come back here
* Start with the lectures from [week 8](/page/80)
* Start with [pset 7](http://cs50.mprog.nl/page/191)

Mind that you use about one week per problem set, be it from 600 or CS50. Then, you'll have plenty of time left to do a nice project in the second part of this course.
