Project specification
=====================
The goal of this project is to create a simple blog where a user can post
updates. These posts are formatted using the
[markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) syntax.  The blogger should
also be able to delete and edit previous posts.

The administrative tasks (e.g. create, edit and delete posts) should be secured
using a password.

When other users view the blog they should not see more than 10 posts at a
time. Do make sure that all posts are be viewable.

For the hacker-edition the blogger should have the ability to upload pictures.

Schedule
========
This project should be doable in six days of 6-7 hours each:

* Day 1: Log in (secure administrative tasks)
* Day 2: Create new posts
* Day 3: Parse markdown
* Day 5: Comment on posts
* Day 4: Update/delete existing posts
* Day 6: Paginate posts (10 per page)
