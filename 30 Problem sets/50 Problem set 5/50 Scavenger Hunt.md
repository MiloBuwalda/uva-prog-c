# Hunting for Photo's

* If you've finished recover.c you can run it on [this raw file](uva.raw). You
  will find a bunch of photo's taken inside the Science Park, not too far away
  from A1.20 and A1.22.

* You must find all of these locations, prove to us that you've been there (we
  suggest using photographs) and you can win fabulous prices!

## DEADLINE

* We will accept entries up and until the **2nd of april, 2013**.
