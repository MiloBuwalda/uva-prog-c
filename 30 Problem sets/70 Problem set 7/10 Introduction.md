# Introduction

You might need to enable Apache on your virtual machine for this problem set.
Perform the following commands in your terminal to do so:

	sudo chkconfig httpd on
	sudo service httpd start
  
Note that, unlike previous problem sets, this problem set will be graded live.
When you are done with your implementation, you should dump your MySQL database
and then compress both your website implementation and your database together in
a single file called pset7.tar.gz. You can do so with the following command:

	tar -czvf pset7.tar.gz pset7
  
Make sure your database rests within a seperate folder within your pset7 folder,
such as pset7/db, to ensure that it is actually included in the compressed file.
Then, upload your compressed file as you would normally do for other problem
sets.

Then, make sure your website is ready to be shown to us. We will grade the site
on your own laptop or on the computer of your choice, and on the browser of your
choice. We will try out some typical things on your site (logging in, buying and
selling some stocks, thins like that) to ensure ourselves it works correctly.
Afterwards, we take a look at a few of the files that make up your website, and
then you will receive a number grade between 1 and 10 bases on the performance
of your website and the structure of your code.

As of now, the following grading moments for problem set 7 are possible:

	monday okt 28  : 13.00 - 17.00
	tuesday okt 29 : 11.00 - 13.00
	monday nov 4   : 11.00 - 17.00
	monday nov 11  : 11.00 - 17.00
	monday nov 18  : 11.00 - 17.00
