# Introduction

* The climax of this course is its final project. The final project is your 
  opportunity to take your newfound savvy with programming out for a spin 
  and develop your very own piece of software. So long as your project draws 
  upon this course's lessons, the nature of your project is entirely up to you. 
  You may implement your project in any language(s). You are welcome to utilize 
  infrastructure other than the CS50 Appliance. All that we ask is that you 
  build something of interest to you, that you solve an actual problem, that you
  impact your community, or that you change the world. Strive to create 
  something that outlives this course.

* Inasmuch as software development is rarely a one-person effort, you are 
  allowed an opportunity to collaborate with one or two classmates for this 
  final project. Needless to say, it is expected that every student in any such 
  group contribute equally to the design and implementation of that group's 
  project. Moreover, it is expected that the scope of a two- or three-person 
  group's project be, respectively, twice or thrice that of a typical one-person
  project. A one-person project, mind you, should entail more time and effort 
  than is required by each of the course's problem sets.
  
* See the **project** tab for more information.
