# Project

"Problem set 8" is your final project!

## Specifications

* First off, you should pick a subject or theme for whatever you are going to
  build. You are free to pick anything of interest to you, but keep in mind
  that it should build upon what you've learned during the course.
  
* In addition, you'll need to decide whether you'll work alone or in a
  group of at most three people. Realize that we expect the scope of your work
  to be equal to the amount of people working on it, and that each person's
  contribution to the work must be equal.
  
* **Proposal:** Once you've settled for a subject and a group setup, you'll 
  need to propose your idea to the course instructors. Your proposal must be
  accepted by the course instructors before you can continue.
  
* Once your proposal has been accepted, you can work on your project! We've
  prepared a few tips for you over in the **getting started** tab.
