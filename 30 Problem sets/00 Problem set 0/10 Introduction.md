# Introduction

* Problem sets come with a PDF file describing the assignment(s) required for a
  given week. You can download these files (called **specifications**) for each
  week under the **Problem set** tab, just above this description.

* Problem sets always come with extra video tutorials and other resources to
  help you along the way. You can find these under the **Walkthrough** tab.
  
* Most problems sets come with a *Normal edition* and a *Hacker edition*. The 
  Hacker edition contains harder and more challenging assignments. While we 
  would advise most anyone to choose the Standard edition, if you feel that you 
  finish very quickly or you want a bit of extra fun, definitely do the Hacker
  edition!

* When you are finished with your assignments, you can submit them to us for
  grading under the **Submit** tab.
