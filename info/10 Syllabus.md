# CS50 @ Minor Programmeren

Edition: February 2013

![CS50 banner](cs50.png)

Introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art
of programming. This course teaches students how to think algorithmically and
solve problems efficiently. Topics include abstraction, algorithms,
encapsulation, data structures, databases, memory management, security,
software development, virtualization, and websites. Languages include C, PHP,
and JavaScript plus SQL, CSS, and HTML. Problem sets inspired by real-world
domains of biology, cryptography, finance, forensics, and gaming. Designed for
concentrators and non-concentrators alike, with or without prior programming
experience.

## Expectations

You are expected to view all lectures and sections, submit nine problem sets, take two quizzes, and submit a final project.

## Grades

All students must ordinarily submit all nine problem sets, take both quizzes, and submit a final project in order to be eligible for a passing grade (i.e., 6-10) unless granted an exception in writing by the course’s instructor.

Final grades will be determined using the following weights:

> **Problem Sets[^*]:** 80%  
> **Final Project**: 20%

Please note that you have to do two tests. You do not have to pass the first test (for *Programmeren 1*), but it is compulsory to pass the second one (for *Programmeren 2*).

Problem sets and the final project will be evaluated along axes of scope, correctness, design, and style.

Know that CS50 draws quite the spectrum of students, including "those less comfortable," "those more comfortable," and those somewhere in between. However, what ultimately matters in this course is not so much where you end up relative to your classmates but where you, in Week 15, end up relative to yourself in Week 0.

The course is not graded on a curve. The course does not have pre-determined cutoffs for final grades. Those less comfortable and somewhere in between are not at a disadvantage vis-à-vis those more comfortable. Scores on problem sets and the final project are normalized across sections at term's end. Each student's final grade is individually determined at term’s end after input from the teaching fellows. Remarkable effort and upward trending do not go unnoticed.

## Books

No books are required for this course. However, you may want to supplement your preparation for or review of some lectures with self-assigned readings relevant to those lectures' content from either of the books below. The first is intended for those inexperienced in (or less comfortable with the idea of) programming. The second is intended for those experienced in (or more comfortable with the idea of) programming. Both are available for purchase at sites like Amazon.com. Realize that free, if not superior, resources can be found on the course's website.

## Sections

Lectures are supplemented by weekly, 90-minute sections led by the teaching fellows. Sections provide you with opportunities to explore and discuss course materials in a more intimate environment, with only your teaching fellow and a handful of classmates present, as well as to dive into hands-on activities.

Different sections are offered for those less comfortable, those more comfortable, and those somewhere in between.

Sectioning begins in Week 1. Sections themselves begin in Week 3, with course-wide supersections (open to all students) offered in Week 2.

## Walkthroughs

On Sunday nights from 7:00pm until 8:30pm, the teaching fellows hold a "walkthrough" for the current week’s problem set during which you receive direction on where to begin and how to approach the week's challenges.
Each walkthrough is filmed and made available within 24 hours in streaming and downloadable formats (MP3 and MP4). You are expected to attend or watch walkthroughs before asking questions about problem sets.

## Office Hours

Office hours are opportunities for one-on-one assistance with problem sets alongside the course's teaching fellows and course assistants.

## Problem Sets

Nine problem sets are assigned during the semester. Each is due via electronic submission six or more days after its date of distribution. However, you have four "late days" that you may "spend" during the semester, each of which provides you with an extension of twenty-four hours. You may spend no more than one late day on any particular problem set. You need not inform the staff of your use of a late day; usage of late days is tracked automatically. Lateness of electronic submissions is determined down to the minute by submissions' timestamps. Submitting more than seven minutes late is equivalent to submitting twenty-four hours late. Late work is not accepted once you have exhausted your late days, except in cases of emergency. Technical difficulties are not considered emergencies. These late days cannot be spent on the course’s final project.

In order to accommodate students with different backgrounds, some problem sets are released in two editions: a standard edition intended for most students and a “Hacker Edition” intended for some students. Both editions essentially cover the same material. But the Hacker Edition typically presents that material from a more technical angle and poses more sophisticated questions. Hacker Editions are graded separately from standard editions, but those students who submit the former do not receive any form of extra credit outright. When determining grades at term’s end, however, we do bear in mind submissions of Hacker Editions.

To be clear, we encourage most students (including aspiring computer scientists) to tackle the standard editions. However, you may choose, week to week, which edition to submit. You may not submit both or some amalgam of the two.

Although you must submit all nine problem sets, your lowest score among those problem sets on which you received a score of perfection for the axis of scope will be dropped when final grades are determined.

A schedule of problem sets, subject to change, appears below.

**Problem Set 0: Scratch**  
due by noon on Thu 16-feb

**Problem Set 1: C**  
due by noon on Thu 23-feb

## Quizzes

The course has two 75-minute quizzes. These quizzes are "closed-book," but you may utilize during each quiz one two-sided page (A4) of notes, typed or written, and a pen or pencil, nothing else.

When final grades are computed, your scores on these two quizzes are weighted equally.

A schedule of quizzes, subject to change, appears below; these quizzes take place in lieu of lectures on these dates.

> **Quiz 0**  
> Wed 21-mrt
> 
> Covers weeks 0 through 5.
> 
> **Quiz 1**  
> Wed 9-mei
> 
> Covers weeks 0 through 10 with emphasis on 7 onward.

Unless arranged with the staff in advance, quizzes may not be taken at alternative times even if missed by accident, except in cases of emergency.

## Final Project

The climax of this course is its final project. The final project is your opportunity to take your knowledge of programming out for a spin and develop your very own piece of software. So long as your project draws upon this course’s lessons, the nature of your project is entirely up to you, albeit subject to the staff’s approval. You may implement your project in any language(s) as long as the staff approves. You are welcome to utilize infrastructure other than the CS50 Appliance and cloud.cs50.net, provided the staff ultimately has access to any hardware and software that your project requires. All that we ask is that you build something of interest to you, that you make something useful, that you solve an actual problem, or that you somehow impact campus. Strive to create something that outlives this course.

Inasmuch as software development is rarely a one-person effort, you are allowed an opportunity to collaborate with one or two fellow students for this final project. Needless to say, it is expected that every student in any such group contribute equally to the design and implementation of that group’s project. Moreover, it is expected that the scope of a two- or three-person group's project be, respectively, twice or thrice that of a typical one-person project. A one-person project, mind you, should entail more time and effort than is required by each of the course’s problem sets.

Guidelines for the final project will be distributed by Mon 10/24. A schedule, subject to change, appears below.

**Pre-Proposal**  
due by noon on Mon 23-apr

**Proposal**  
due by noon on Mon 27-apr

**Status Report**  
due by noon on Mon 21-mei

**Implementation**  
due by noon on Thu 24-mei

Extensions on the final project are not granted, except in cases of emergency. Technical difficulties are not considered emergencies. Problem sets' late days cannot be spent on the final project. Lateness of submissions is determined down to the minute by submissions' timestamps. Submitting more than seven minutes late is equivalent to not submitting at all.

## Academic Honesty

All work that you do toward fulfillment of this course’s expectations must be your own unless collaboration is explicitly allowed in writing by the course’s instructor. Collaboration in the completion of problem sets is not permitted unless otherwise stated by some problem set’s specification.

Viewing or copying another individual’s work (even if left by a printer, stored in an executable directory, or accidentally shared in the course’s virtual terminal room) or lifting material from a book, website, or other source—even in part—and presenting it as your own constitutes academic dishonesty, as does showing or giving your work, even in part, to another student or soliciting the work of another individual. Similarly is dual submission academic dishonesty: you may not submit the same or similar work to this course that you have submitted or will submit to another. Nor may you provide or make available solutions to problem sets to individuals who take or may take this course in the future. Moreover, submission of any work that you intend to use outside of the course (e.g., for a job) must be approved by the staff.

You are welcome to discuss the course’s material with others in order to better understand it. You may even discuss problem sets with classmates, but you may not share code. In other words, you may communicate with classmates in English, but you may not communicate in, say, C. If in doubt as to the appropriateness of some discussion, contact the course’s instructor.

You may turn to the Web for instruction beyond the course’s lectures and sections, for references, and for solutions to technical difficulties, but not for outright solutions to problems on problem sets or your own final project. However, failure to cite (as with comments) the origin of any code or technique that you do discover outside of the course’s lectures and sections (even while respecting these constraints) and then integrate into your own work may be considered academic dishonesty.

All forms of academic dishonesty are dealt with harshly. If the course refers some matter to the Administrative Board and the outcome for some student is Admonish, Probation, Requirement to Withdraw, or Recommendation to Dismiss, the course reserves the right to impose local sanctions on top of that outcome for that student that may include, but not be limited to, a failing grade for work submitted or for the course itself.
