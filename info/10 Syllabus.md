*Edition: February 2013*

CS50 is an introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science
and the art of programming. This course teaches students how to think
algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. Topics include abstraction,
algorithms, encapsulation, data structures, databases, memory management,
security, software development, virtualization, and websites. Languages
include C, PHP, and JavaScript plus SQL, CSS, and HTML. Problem sets inspired
by real-world domains of biology, cryptography, finance, forensics, and
gaming. Designed for concentrators and non-concentrators alike, with or
without prior programming experience.

## Prerequisite

None -- definitely no programming experience needed.

## Expectations

You are expected to watch all lectures and sections, submit eight problem
sets, take two quizzes, and submit a final project.

## Grades

You will receive a final grade for the course if:

* you've attended all lab sessions during the course;
* you've submitted every problem set working and on time;
* you've passed the quizzes.

Should you not have succeeded in doing one of those, we cannot give you a
final grade. Still, we are most certain that every student should be able to
pass the course!

The grade of **Part 1** will be determined using the following weights:

* Problem Sets 0--4: 100%
* Quiz 0: 0% (but needs to be passed)

The grade of **Part 2** will be determined using the following weights:

* Problem Sets 5--7: 60%
* Final Project: 40%
* Quiz 1: 0% (but needs to be passed)

Problem sets and the final project will be evaluated along axes of:

* Scope, 
* Correctness, 
* Design and 
* Style.

Know that CS50 draws quite the spectrum of students, including *those less
comfortable*, *those more comfortable*, and those somewhere in between.
However, what ultimately matters in this course is not so much where you end
up relative to your classmates but where you end up relative to yourself
before you took this course.

The course is *not* graded on a curve. The course does *not* have
pre-determined cutoffs for final grades. Those less comfortable and somewhere
in between are *not at a disadvantage* vis-à-vis those more comfortable. Each
student's final grade is individually determined at term’s end after input
from the assistants. Remarkable effort and upward trending do not go
unnoticed.

## Books

No books are required for this course. However, we do have a number of books
available for you to read during office hours. You are welcome to pick up one
of these and read them as a preparation for or review of one of the lectures.
For those who like books anyway, here are some good suggestions:

> **For Those Less Comfortable**
> 
> Absolute Beginner’s Guide to C, Second Edition
> Greg Perry
> Sams Publishing, 1994
> ISBN 0-672-30510-0
> 
> **For Those More Comfortable**
> Programming in C, Third Edition
> Stephen Kochan
> Sams Publishing, 2004
> ISBN 0-672-32666-3

The book below is recommended for those interested in understanding how their
own computers work for personal edification.

> How Computers Work, Ninth Edition Ron White
> Que Publishing, 2007
> ISBN 0-7897-3613-6

This last book below is recommended for aspiring hackers, those interested in
programming tricks and low-level optimization of code for applications beyond
the scope of this course.

> Hacker's Delight
> Henry S. Warren Jr.
> Addison-Wesley, 2003

## Course contents

### Lectures

These discuss all theory that is needed to pass the quizzes.

### Sections

Lectures are supplemented by weekly, 90-minute sections led by the Harvard
teaching fellows. Sections provide you with opportunities to explore and
discuss course materials in a more intimate environment.

### Walkthroughs

These discuss the current week's problem set. This is where you receive
direction on where to begin and how to approach the week's challenges.

### Problem Sets

The eight problem sets are the hard work of the course. You are supposed to
work on them in the lab most of the time, where you can ask questions to the
teaching assistants.

You have four "late days" that you may "spend" during the semester, each of
which provides you with an extension of twenty-four hours. You may spend no
more than one late day on any particular problem set. You need not inform the
staff of your use of a late day; usage of late days is tracked automatically.
Lateness of electronic submissions is determined down to the minute by
submissions' timestamps. Submitting more than seven minutes late is equivalent
to submitting twenty-four hours late. Late work is not accepted once you have
exhausted your late days, except in cases of emergency. Technical difficulties
are not considered emergencies. These late days cannot be spent on the
course's final project.

In order to accommodate students with different backgrounds, some problem sets
are released in two editions: a standard edition intended for most students
and a "Hacker Edition" intended for some students. Both editions essentially
cover the same material. But the Hacker Edition typically presents that
material from a more technical angle and poses more sophisticated questions.
Hacker Editions are graded separately from standard editions, but those
students who submit the former do not receive any form of extra credit
outright. When determining grades at term's end, however, we do bear in mind
submissions of Hacker Editions.

To be clear, we encourage most students (including aspiring computer
scientists) to tackle the standard editions. However, you may choose, week to
week, which edition to submit. You may not submit both or some amalgam of the
two.

### Quizzes

The course has two 75-minute quizzes. These quizzes are "closed-book," but you
may utilize during each quiz one two-sided page (A4) of notes, typed or
written, and a pen or pencil, nothing else.

### Final Project

The climax of this course is its final project. The final project is your
opportunity to take your knowledge of programming out for a spin and develop
your very own piece of software. So long as your project draws upon this
course's lessons, the nature of your project is entirely up to you, albeit
subject to the staff's approval. You may implement your project in any
language(s) as long as the staff approves. You are welcome to utilize
infrastructure other than the CS50 Appliance, provided the staff ultimately
has access to any hardware and software that your project requires. All that
we ask is that you build something of interest to you, that you make something
useful, that you solve an actual problem, or that you somehow impact campus.
Strive to create something that outlives this course.

Inasmuch as software development is rarely a one-person effort, you are
allowed an opportunity to collaborate with one or two fellow students for this
final project. Needless to say, it is expected that every student in any such
group contribute equally to the design and implementation of that group’s
project. Moreover, it is expected that the scope of a two- or three-person
group's project be, respectively, twice or thrice that of a typical one-person
project. A one-person project, mind you, should entail more time and effort
than is required by each of the course's problem sets.

Extensions on the final project are not granted, except in cases of emergency.
Technical difficulties are not considered emergencies. Problem sets' late days
cannot be spent on the final project. Lateness of submissions is determined
down to the minute by submissions' timestamps. Submitting more than seven
minutes late is equivalent to not submitting at all.
