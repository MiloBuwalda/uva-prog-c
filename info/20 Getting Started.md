# Getting Started #

This is quite the course, so let's start simple.

- Read the Syllabus.
- Read about Acing this course.
- Have a good look at the 8-week or 16-week schedule.
- Watch the first lecture.
- Start your first assignment!

## Using Linux machines

Linux computers are available at the Faculty of Science. It is very well
possible that you are not yet allowed to login. If you are not using the CS50
Appliance, you will need to be able to login by Problem Set 1!

If needed, please send an email to <help@mprog.nl>, explaining that you cannot
log in.

Before you start working on Problem Set 1, execute the following command in
the terminal of those computers:

	/home/mstegem1/soft/bin/cs50

You only have to do this **once**.

## Submitting your programs ##

Once you're done with your problem set, you can submit it using the submit tab
that you'll find on the page of that problem set. If a .tar.gz file is
required, you can use the following commands to create this archive:

    make clean
    tar -czvf psetX.tar.gz *

## Transitioning from other courses ##

### Transitioning from Java

If you have done a 6 credit Java course you can start like this. Note that you
cannot do this program if you already have a web programming course in your
major!

* Read "[C for Java programmers](http://faculty.ksu.edu.sa/jebari_chaker/papers/C_for_Java_Programmers.pdf)".
* Watch the Week 4 Wednesday lecture.
* Watch the Week 4 section.
* Read problem set 5, mark things you don't understand.
* Watch the Week 5 lectures.
* Try starting on pset 5.
* Watch the pset 5 walkthrough.

### Transitioning from MIT 6.00 in Python ###

If you've done the first part of the MIT 600 course, it's best to do a few
more problem sets from that course, and then return here for pset7.

* Do MIT problem sets [5 and 6](http://py.mprog.nl/).
* Come back here.
* Start with the lectures from week 8.
* Start with Problem Set 7.

Mind that you take about one week per problem set, be it from 600 or CS50, so
you'll have plenty of time left to do a nice project in the second part of
this course.
