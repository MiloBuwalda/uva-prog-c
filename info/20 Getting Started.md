# Where do I start?

* Watch the first two lectures: [Week 0 Wednesday and Friday](lectures/week-0)

* Start programming in Scratch in the [first problem
  set](problem-sets/problem-set-0)!


# Workflow

## Lecture notes

Start by reading the lecture notes. These can be found on the page of that
specific lecture. These give you a good indication of what you should know to
finish a problem set.

## Lecture

Now you can watch the lecture. Do this before or on your way to the lab
sessions, so that you can spend your lab time, when you can ask questions, on
the assignments.

## Problem set

Read the problem set specification completely and try to work out by hand, e.g.
with pen and paper, how you would perform the tasks of that problem set before
you start writing code.

## *(Sections)*

If you haven't fully grasped the lecture, the sections of the following week
are a more in depth discussion of the material discussed in that lecture. The
sections also provide some extra examples that might help you to get started on
your problem set.

## *(Walkthrough)*

If after all of this you are still unsure where to start with your problem set,
you can watch the walkthrough. You can find the walkthrough in the second tab
of the problem set.

## *(Hacker Edition)*

If the assignment was a breeze, we strongly urge you to do the hacker edition
of the assignment. This edition provides an extra challenge for those *more
comfortable*.

## Test preparation

To prepare for the tests, you should regularly reread the lecture notes and ask
the assistants to help you if anything is unclear, e.g. pointers in C.

## Working on UvA lab machines

Before you start working on problem set 1, execute the following command in the
terminal of a linux-machine on the UvA:

	/home/mstegem1/soft/bin/cs50

You only have to do this **once**.
