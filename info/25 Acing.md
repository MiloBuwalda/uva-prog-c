# How to ace this course #

You're on your own through this course most of the time, though we will be,
quite literally, on your side when you're in the labs.

Make good use of the various materials that are in the course. Here's a guided
tour through the important parts.

## Lecture notes

Start by reading the lecture notes. These can be found on the page of that
specific lecture. These give you a good indication of what you should know to
finish a problem set.

## Lectures

Now you can watch the lecture. Do this before or on your way to the lab
sessions (so not *during* the lab sessions), in order to be able to spend your
lab time programming and asking good questions about the problem sets.

## Problem sets

Read the problem set specification completely and try to work out by hand,
with pen and paper, what tasks your program should perform, *before*
you start writing code.

## Sections

If you haven't fully grasped the lecture, the sections of the following week
are a more in depth discussion of some of the best stuff discussed in that
lecture. The sections also provide some extra examples that may help you get
started on your problem set.

## Walkthrough

If after all of this you are still unsure where to start with your problem
set, you can watch the walkthrough. You can find the walkthroughs on the
problem set pages.

## Hacker Edition

If the assignment was a breeze, we would love you to do the hacker edition of
the assignment. This is quite a bit more difficult, and a great challenge for
those *more comfortable*.

## Test preparation

To prepare for the tests, you should regularly re-read the lecture notes and
ask the assistants to help you if anything is unclear, like those darn
*pointers*.
