# Course components

You're on your own through this course most of the time, though we will be,
quite literally, on your side when you're in the labs.

Make good use of the various materials that are in the course. Here's a guided
tour through the important parts.

## Lectures

These discuss all theory that is needed to pass the quizzes. Lecture notes can
be found on the page of each lecture. Watch the lectures before or on your way
to the lab sessions, in order to be able to spend your lab time programming and
asking questions.

## Sections

Lectures are supplemented by weekly, 90-minute sections led by the Harvard
teaching fellows. Sections more thoroughly discuss some of the material from
the lectures.

## Walkthroughs

These discuss the current week's problem set. This is where you receive
direction on where to begin and how to approach the week's challenges.

## Problem Sets

The seven problem sets and the final project are the hard work of the course, on
which you will spend most of the lab time and then some more.

You have four "late days" that you may "spend" during the semester, each of
which provides you with an extension of twenty-four hours. You may spend no
more than one late day on any particular problem set. You need not inform the
staff of your use of a late day; usage of late days is tracked automatically.
Lateness of electronic submissions is determined down to the minute by
submissions' timestamps. Submitting more than seven minutes late is equivalent
to submitting twenty-four hours late. Late work is not accepted once you have
exhausted your late days, except in cases of emergency. Technical difficulties
are not considered emergencies. These late days cannot be spent on the
course's final project.

In order to accommodate students with different backgrounds, some problem sets
are released in two editions: a standard edition intended for most students
and a "Hacker Edition" intended for some students. Both editions essentially
cover the same material. But the Hacker Edition typically presents that
material from a more technical angle and poses more sophisticated questions.
Hacker Editions are graded separately from standard editions, but those
students who submit the former do not receive any form of extra credit
outright.

To be clear, we encourage most students (including aspiring computer
scientists) to tackle the standard editions. However, you may choose, week to
week, which edition to submit. You may not submit both or some amalgam of the
two.

Problem sets and the final project will be evaluated along the following axes:

* Scope

	Have you tried doing everything?

	0. empty or not submitted
	1. incomplete
	2. most of it is there, but a small part is missing
	3. you've done everything required
	4. you've tried some extras
	5. above and beyond: a real extra
	{: start="0"}

* Correctness

	Does your program do what is expected by a user?

	0. will not work at all
	1. takes too much time to get it working
	2. some problems, but we can fix them, probably a mistake
	3. it works, but not necessarily always the correct result
	4. correct results in all common cases of input
	5. perfection: always correct, even with erroneous input
	{: start="0"}

* Design

	How orderly is your code?

	0. we are unable to understand the structure
	1. lots of complex code and/or trying to avoid newly learned constructs
	2. too complicated, but you know your stuff
	3. straightforward code, could be put a bit inefficiently
	4. makes good use of the possibilities in the language
	5. perfection: you've read up on design and applied it to your code
	{: start="0"}

* Style

	How readable is your code?

	0. completely unreadable to us
	1. once or twice you did it right, but you should study the style guide
	2. you've read the style guide but haven't applied it consistently
	3. your code is readable and consistent, barring some minor problems
	4. the code is consistent, and only well-reasoned deviations from the guide
	5. perfection: you've made your own choices but maintained consistency
	{: start="0"}

Grades are ordinarily determined by

$$"scope" * (3 * "correctness" + 2 * "design" + 1 * "style")$$.

Scores are normalized across TFs at term's end, so mid-semester comparisons
among students of scores are not reliable indicators of standing.

Although you must submit all eight problem sets, your lowest score among those
problem sets on which you received perfect scores for the axis of scope will be
dropped when final grades are determined.

## Quizzes

The course has two 2-hour quizzes. These quizzes are "closed-book," but you
may utilize during each quiz one two-sided page (A4) of notes, typed or
written, and a pen or pencil, nothing else.

To prepare, regularly re-read the lecture notes and be sure to ask the course
assistants to help you find answers if anything is unclear.

## Final Project

The climax of this course is its final project. The final project is your
opportunity to take your knowledge of programming out for a spin and develop
your very own piece of software. So long as your project draws upon this
course's lessons, the nature of your project is entirely up to you, albeit
subject to the staff's approval. You may implement your project in any
language(s) as long as the staff approves. You are welcome to utilize
infrastructure other than the CS50 Appliance, provided the staff ultimately
has access to any hardware and software that your project requires. All that
we ask is that you build something of interest to you, that you make something
useful, that you solve an actual problem, or that you somehow impact campus.
Strive to create something that outlives this course.

Inasmuch as software development is rarely a one-person effort, you are
allowed an opportunity to collaborate with one or two fellow students for this
final project. Needless to say, it is expected that every student in any such
group contribute equally to the design and implementation of that groupâ€™s
project. Moreover, it is expected that the scope of a two- or three-person
group's project be, respectively, twice or thrice that of a typical one-person
project. A one-person project, mind you, should entail more time and effort
than is required by each of the course's problem sets.

Extensions on the final project are not granted, except in cases of emergency.
Technical difficulties are not considered emergencies. Problem sets' late days
cannot be spent on the final project. Lateness of submissions is determined
down to the minute by submissions' timestamps. Submitting more than seven
minutes late is equivalent to not submitting at all.
