## Introduction to sections

* Sections supplement lectures and offer a more detailed approach to the matter
  at hand. They discuss both theory you need to know for your quizzes as well as
  implementation details required for the assignments. 
  
* We recommend you to watch the weekly lecture(s) before you turn to these
  sections. 
  
* There is a total of nine pairs of sections; each consisting of a section for 
  those *more comfortable* and for those *less comfortable*. Both cover more or 
  less the same material, so you only need to watch one section of each pair.
