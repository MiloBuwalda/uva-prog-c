Have a look at the web site [Learning C from Java][1] by Steven Simpson. You do
not need to learn about pointers yet, it'll come up in the lectures.

After that, take the following steps to get started:

* Watch the Week 4 Wednesday lecture.
* Watch the Week 4 section.
* Read problem set 5, mark things you don't understand.
* Watch the Week 5 lectures.
* Try starting on pset 5.
* Watch the pset 5 walkthrough.
